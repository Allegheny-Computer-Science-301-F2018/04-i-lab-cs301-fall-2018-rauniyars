Question 7.

Q. Use data exploration to determine if other diseases (besides Measles) have enough data to explore the effects of vaccines. Be critical of your online research. Are you convinced by the primary or credible articles that you have found? Be sure to cite all articles.

A. I researched about the effect of Rubella and Total Tetanus and I got a positive result as I had expected. Looking at the decrease in number of cases inclined towards the bright side of vaccines. It cannot be denied that with any medicine, there might be side-effects or allergic reactions but the fear of that shouldn't be the reason we walk away from vaccines and put our life at stake.

This data presents a detailed research on vaccines especially its impact and the data tells how positive the result has been as there has been a significant decrease in the spread of these life-threatening diseases. Yes. I am convinced as it has been published a widely recognized organization that is, WHO and they keep updating their data very often.

Question 8.

Q. In the New York Times article, entitled, “Journal Retracts 1998 Paper Linking Autism to Vaccines” by Gardiner Harris  (https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/03/health/research/ 03lancet.html) a research article written by Dr. Andrew Wakefield has been retracted by the authors because it suggests that autism followed from the use of vaccines. Read the article to answer the following reflection questions to place in your writing/reportAndReflections.md file.

•	What is the damage to the public medicine and public opinion from such an article which states (incorrectly) that autism is a result of vaccines?
  As mentioned in the article by Jim Moody, director of SafeMinds, “Attacking scientists and attacking doctors is dangerous,”. The public relies on scientists, researchers and doctors in order to ensure what is the best for them. Hence, it is the job of these experts that they serve them well by releasing the accurate result especially in a situation when health is involved. When the public lose their trust from these experts, they are bound to do things that are not supposed to be done and hence that could lead to difficult circumstances.

•	What should the role of academic research groups and organizations be to ensure that published information is absolutely correct (i.e., has been properly analyzed) before public exposure?
  Data has been a significant part in the world of science to analyze and interpret different area. The people are highly depended on the data that they receive and act according to them. Research groups should collect data from a wide variety and also from different regions rather than a specific one. This will allow them to get diverse results and in this way they can come to a broader conclusion.


•	The researcher retracted his paper, which means that he no longer supports its content. Is retracting a paper enough to fix the damage to public medicine? How could the damage be fixed if this you do not think that this is enough?
  Retracting the paper is definitely not enough to stop the damage as the damage has already been done. People who followed the news must have avoided the vaccination and that might cause a great problem for them. Time factor is a major issue here which is why we cannot change what happened especially when health is a major concern in here. This should be a huge lesson for those peope who come up with unique results during their research. It isn't wrong to have odd results. If that was the case, how would people keep discovering new things? What is important is that people ought to do deeper research when they get results different to others and keep on researching intensely and apply it diversely until they are confident about their result.

Question 9.
Q. During the talk concerning Global Health, given by Dr. Becky Dawson and Dr. Amelia Finaret on Friday, 28th September, one of the main points is that data is used to fight disease and to track out-breaks of serious ailments in diverse communities all over the world. Find two sets of (publicly available) data from the World Health Organization which could be used in a project to determine whether vaccines are beneficial, in any capacity.

A.

This data reports the cases on Polio and Neonatal Tetanus respectively for different countries. Going through the data, we can see the previous years when vaccinations were not very popular, there were a lot of reported cases. However, with time and increase in the number of vaccinations supported my WHO, we could see a decrease in the number of cases.

Question 10.

Q. Write your reactions to the talk and discuss an idea which resonated with you.
A. The talk was a very informative one giving us a broad concept of how we can use the data that we have for the best of people. It helped me look at the world of Computer Science in a slightly different perspective. I say so because when the word 'Computer Science' or 'Data Analytics' strikes your mind, you are more than likely to think about code and programming stuff. I knew that data is an immensely important information but I didn't realize that it could be of so much help in the field of health and many other areas. It is wonderful how the data we collect can help us in carving a direction to our result. The speakers mentioned that there is tons of data online but what is important is that we need to understand it. Data Analytics helps us do so and with this we can find a pattern and serve the people in different field of expertise by providing them reliable information. The talk was indeed a valuable one as they also mentioned some of the reliable sources and hence this will help me to keep an eye on accurate stuff and stay away from the inaccurate ones. Nevertheless, this talk helped me understand the importance of data, more importantly correct data and make the best use of it in helping people in different areas.
